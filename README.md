### [Deploy preview](https://amazing-mcnulty-45a0ca.netlify.com/)

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

Installing the project dependencies

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

### `npm run eject`

This command will remove the single build dependency from project and provides you config packages, including the `webpack.config`.
In my opinion, this project doesn't require additional package bundler setup. What I would recommend is to not ejecting the packed dependencies due to their optimization from the React team. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
